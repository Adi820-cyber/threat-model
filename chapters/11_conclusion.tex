\section*{Conclusion and Future Directions}
Threat modeling is a cornerstone of modern cybersecurity, enabling organizations to proactively identify, analyze, and mitigate threats before they can be exploited\cite{shostack2014,uceda2015,owasp}. This report has covered the evolution of threat modeling, key frameworks (STRIDE, PASTA, Trike, VAST, OCTAVE, OWASP), practical methodologies, a real-world case study, and hands-on labs.

\subsection*{Key Takeaways}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Threat modeling should be integrated into every stage of the software development lifecycle (SDLC)\cite{shostack2014}.
	\item No single framework fits all needs; select based on context, risk, and organizational requirements\cite{uceda2015}.
	\item Collaboration between technical and business stakeholders is essential for effective risk management\cite{nist800154}.
	\item Continuous improvement and regular reviews are critical for staying ahead of evolving threats\cite{owasp}.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Emerging Trends}
\begin{itemize}
	\item AI-driven threat modeling and automated risk analysis\cite{owasp}
	\item Threat modeling for cloud-native, IoT, and supply chain security\cite{nist800154}
	\item Integration with DevSecOps and CI/CD pipelines\cite{owasp}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Actionable Recommendations}
\begin{itemize}
	\item Invest in training and awareness for all team members
	\item Use a combination of frameworks and tools for comprehensive coverage
	\item Share threat models and lessons learned with the security community
	\item Stay informed about new threats, vulnerabilities, and best practices\cite{owasp,shostack2014}
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Final Thoughts}
Threat modeling is not a one-time activity but an ongoing process that adapts to new technologies, threats, and business needs. By adopting a structured, reference-driven approach, organizations can build more resilient systems and foster a culture of security.
