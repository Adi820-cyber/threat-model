\title{Web Application Threat Model}

\begin{abstract}
In cybersecurity, finding vulnerabilities is not just about scanning or exploiting; it begins with structured steps that build awareness of the target system. After planning the approach and gathering information about the application, the next step is threat modeling. At this stage we shift perspective from attacker to protector: instead of asking "how can we break the system," we ask "where could the system break, and how can we defend it."

Threat modeling works like mapping the weak points of a house before a storm. We examine how attackers might attempt entry, what they could achieve, and the possible business impact if they succeed. This report studies established methodologies such as STRIDE, PASTA, OWASP threat categories, and NIST risk guidance. Each framework provides a structured way to recognize potential weaknesses in a web application before attackers exploit them.

We describe threats in everyday terms—such as using stolen credentials to impersonate a user or injecting malicious input to expose private data—and connect them directly to business risks like loss of user trust, downtime, or regulatory penalties. For each identified threat, we highlight realistic security controls including stronger authentication, data validation, encryption, and active monitoring. The purpose of this report is not only technical defense but also to provide non-technical stakeholders with clarity on why these risks matter.
